# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to build and test a simple REST API using the FastAPI framework in Python. Practice designing endpoints, handling requests, and returning JSON responses.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Task 1: Set Up FastAPI Project

#### Description
Set up a new Python project and install FastAPI and Uvicorn. Create a basic FastAPI app with a root endpoint that returns a welcome message.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Have a `main.py` file with a FastAPI app
- Include a root endpoint (`/`) that returns a JSON welcome message
- Use Uvicorn to run the app locally

### 🛠️ Task 2: Create REST Endpoints

#### Description
